Some of the paths for things like the textfilt/defn stuff isn't correct yet

The pstogif tools aren't completely installed

The installation stuff in general needs more and careful testing (so as not to
loose the working versions)

The html.def etc files still seem to live in ~/textfilt !

Doctext needs a way to generate index entries.
