Here is MPI.  
  
Here is an enumeration

which ended here.  And now, a displayed equation  
<p><I>  
A x = n  
</I><p>  
This is an inline <I>  = u </I> equation.  This is an inline equation  
with only regular text <I> a = ( 1,2 ) </I>, and this one has braces <I> { (1,2),  
(3,4)} </I>.  Here are the same things, but using the dollar notation:  
<P> 
<p><I> 
A x = n 
</I><p><P> 
This is an inline <I>epsilon = mu</I> equation.  This is an inline equation  
with only regular text <I>a = ( 1,2 )</I>, and this one has braces <I>{ (1,2), 
(3,4)}</I>.

This is an inline equation with dollars:  <I>&lt;</I>type<I>&gt;</I>.
