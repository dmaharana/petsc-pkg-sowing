Here is MPI.  
  
Here is an enumeration

which ended here.  And now, a displayed equation  
<p><i>  
A x = n  
</i><p>  
This is an inline <i>  = u </i> equation.  This is an inline equation  
with only regular text <i> a = ( 1,2 ) </i>, and this one has braces <i> { (1,2),  
(3,4)} </i>.  Here are the same things, but using the dollar notation:  
<P> 
<p><i> 
A x = n 
</i><p><P> 
This is an inline <i>epsilon = mu</i> equation.  This is an inline equation  
with only regular text <i>a = ( 1,2 )</i>, and this one has braces <i>{ (1,2), 
(3,4)}</i>.  
<P> 
This is an inline equation with dollars:  <i>&lt;</i>type<i>&gt;</i>.
