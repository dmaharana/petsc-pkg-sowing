\section{First Section}

\begin{example}
  A simple example involving \(math\).
\end{example}

Simple math
\( a + b \)
Less simple (braces)
\( \{ a + b \}\)
And with ldots
\( Foo( a + b + \ldots ) \)
Even worse, with subscripts and superscripts 
\( A_1 + B^2 = C_{old} \)

Here is a block of text that caused some problems (overwrites in the
math handling):

When manipulating a preconditioning matrix, \( A \) , BlockSolve95
internally works with a scaled and permuted matrix, \( \hat{A} = P
D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2},\) where \( D \) is the diagonal of \( A \) , and \( P \) is a
permutation matrix determined by a graph coloring for efficient
parallel computation.  Thus, when solving a linear system, \( Ax=b \),
using ILU/ICC preconditioning and the matrix format {\tt MATMPIROWBS}
for {\em both} the linear system matrix and the preconditioning
matrix, one actually solves the scaled and permuted system \( \hat{A}
\hat{x} = \hat{b} \) , where \( \hat{x} = P D^{1/2} x \) and \(\hat{b} = P
D^{-1/2} b\) .
