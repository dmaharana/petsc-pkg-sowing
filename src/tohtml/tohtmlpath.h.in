/* There are two kinds of source paths for the pre-defined bitmaps.  
   One uses a location NOT available to the Web and copies the files into
   the same directory that is holding the generated HTML files.  The
   code generates RELATIVE locations for the bitmaps.
  
   The other uses a location that IS available to the Web, and generates
   ABSOLUTE locations
