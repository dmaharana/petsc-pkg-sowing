This is a replacement set of tests for the bfort and bfort2 codes.

ToDo

Check that these from "testing" are covered:
n1.c - tbase is better
n2.c - MPI (in tmpi.c) and tbase and tref
tstpgma.c - tbase now contains
tstpgma2.c - almost the same as tstpgma.c
tstpgmb.c -  mostly a dup of tstpgma (tstpgma was probably incorrectly updated
from K&R C function declarations)
tstc.c - tchar is better

Note tstpgmaf90 and tstpgmbf90 nearly the same as wellq
