This directory contains the tools that are part of the program development
and maintenance environment.  They are really a collection of mostly
simple tools that help leverage many of the excellent Unix tools for
programmers.

Special notes:
We require a ghostscript that includes the writeppmfile operator.  This was
withdrawn from later ghostscript versions (!).

Rebuilding configure:

setenv PATH /software/common/gnu/bin:$PATH
autoscan
.. check configure.scan 
autoheader
autoconf

Configuring for testing in place

setenv GS /usr/local/bin/gs
configure --enable-strict --datadir=`pwd`/share --prefix=`pwd`

Configuring for local use

(bindir = $exec_prefix/bin by default)
#setenv GS /usr/local/bin/gs   (no longer necessary)
configure --datadir=/homes/gropp/data/share --prefix=/homes/gropp/bin/solaris \
  --bindir=/homes/gropp/bin/solaris
make 
make install
# Repeat for linux replacing solaris (after deleting config.cache!)
